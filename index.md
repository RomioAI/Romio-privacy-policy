# Privacy Policy for Romio

**Effective Date:** August 2, 2025  

Romio (“Romio,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and the choices you have when using our mobile application (“App”).

---

## 1) Information We Collect

- **Account & Auth**: Name, email address, profile image (via Google Sign-In using Supabase Auth).  
- **App Activity**: In-app notification history (linked to your user ID) stored in Supabase.  
- **Device & Diagnostics**: Crash and performance data (e.g., device model, OS version, stack traces) via Firebase Crashlytics.  
- **Push Notifications**: Device tokens (FCM tokens) to deliver notifications.  
- **Advertising Identifiers (if ads are enabled)**: Google Advertising ID or similar identifiers used by ad networks to show personalized or contextual ads.  

> We **do not** intentionally collect sensitive categories (e.g., government IDs, financial account numbers, health data) and **do not** collect precise location unless explicitly requested by a feature and permitted by you.

---

## 2) How We Use Your Information

- Authenticate you and secure your account.  
- Display your content (e.g., saved plans, notifications).  
- Send push notifications you opt into (you can disable in device settings).  
- Monitor stability, diagnose crashes, and improve performance.  
- **Advertising (if enabled)**: Show ads, measure ad performance, and, where permitted, personalize ads.  

---

## 3) Third-Party Services We Use

We share data with service providers only to operate and improve the App:

- **Supabase** (authentication, database & storage)  
- **Firebase Crashlytics** (crash reporting & diagnostics)  
  - Firebase Privacy: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)  
- **Ad Networks (if ads are enabled)**, e.g., Google AdMob / approved partners, which may collect device identifiers and usage info to deliver and measure ads.  

> We **do not sell** your personal information.

---

## 4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)

We process data under:  

- **Consent** (e.g., push notifications, personalized ads where required).  
- **Contract** (to provide core features you request).  
- **Legitimate Interests** (e.g., fraud prevention, crash analytics, service improvement), balanced against your rights.  

You may withdraw consent at any time in the App (where available) or via the contact below.  

---

## 5) Your Rights & Choices

Subject to your location, you may:  

- **Access** the data we hold about you.  
- **Correct** inaccurate data.  
- **Delete** your account and associated data.  
- **Object to / restrict** certain processing.  
- **Withdraw consent** (e.g., for notifications or personalized ads).  

Contact us at **[marcolous11@gmail.com](mailto:marcolous11@gmail.com)** to exercise rights. We may need to verify your identity.  

---

## 6) Data Retention

We keep personal data only as long as needed to provide the App and for legitimate business/legal purposes. When you delete your account, profile data and in-app notification history are deleted (subject to brief backup/archival retention and legal requirements).  

---

## 7) Account & Data Deletion

- **In-App**: Use **Settings → Delete Account** (when available) to request permanent deletion of your account and associated data.  
- **Email**: If the in-app option is unavailable, email **[marcolous11@gmail.com](mailto:marcolous11@gmail.com)** from your account email with the subject **“Romio – Delete My Account.”**  

We aim to complete verified deletion requests within **30 days** and will confirm by email.  

> If a “Delete Account” button appears in the App, it will perform an actual deletion request—**we do not display non-functional deletion controls**.  

---

## 8) Data Security

We use industry-standard measures (e.g., HTTPS/TLS in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we continuously work to protect your data.  

---

## 9) Children’s Privacy

Romio is **not directed to children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child provided data, contact us to delete it.  

---

## 10) International Transfers

Our providers may process data in countries different from yours. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.  

---

## 11) Permissions & Controls

- **Notifications**: You can enable/disable in device settings.  
- **Advertising ID** (if ads are enabled): You can reset or limit ad tracking in device settings.  
- We do not request device permissions beyond what’s necessary for the features you use.  

---

## 12) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We’ll post the updated version in-app or on our website and revise the “Effective Date.” Material changes will be highlighted.
